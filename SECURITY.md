## Reporting a Vulnerability

The project maintainers take security seriously. If you discover a security
issue, please bring it to their attention right away!

**Please _DO NOT_ file a public issue**, instead send your report privately to
contact@blueprintue.com .

Security reports are greatly appreciated.

We currently do not offer a paid security bounty program.
